This is my repo to store anything util script wise




### `autoSelectGitReviewers.js` is useful when your work repo has an unfathomably long list of potential reviewers. You always require the same users and you don't have the required access to create groups

- user ids can be found with api call or simply inspect the dropdown list the value of each select item (checkbox) contains the id and use code commented in file
- I use  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/run-javascript/lmilalhkkdhfieeienjbiicclobibjao to run the code on demand by domain


### `onboardingInstall.sh` is an auto-install script that covers what is needed for my work, will be useful for new hires.
